<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

  <body>


Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information: 
1. The ticker symbol
2. Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
3. The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.
4. The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

NOTE:
Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

  

1. Fork the Project

2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b new-branch-name`)

3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some message'`)

4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin new-branch-name`)

5. Create a pull request. 


Forking a repository and creating a pull request on GitHub is a great way to contribute to open-source projects. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. Forking the Repository:

Find the repository you want to contribute to on GitHub.
Click on the "Fork" button in the top right corner. This creates a copy of the repository in your own account.

2. Clone the Forked Repository to Your Local Machine

You'll need Git installed on your system.
Use Git commands to clone your forked repository to your local machine. There will be instructions on the GitHub repository page for cloning.

3. Making Changes (Local Work):

Make your changes to the code in your local copy.
Use Git commands to track your changes (adding, committing).

4. Pushing Changes to Your Fork:

Once you're happy with your changes, use Git commands to push your local commits to your forked repository on GitHub.

5. Creating a Pull Request:

Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
Click the "Compare & pull request" button (might appear as a yellow banner).
Here, you'll see a comparison between your changes and the original repository.
Write a clear title and description for your pull request explaining the changes you made.
Click "Create Pull Request" to submit it for review.
